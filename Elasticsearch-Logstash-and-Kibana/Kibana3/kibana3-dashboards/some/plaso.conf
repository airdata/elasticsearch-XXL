# Make sure you are using plaso v1.1 or higher.
# Before using plaso with elasticsearch you first need to install some python bindings.
# sudo pip install pyelasticsearch
# 
# log2timeline.py plaso.dump /path/to/disk/image
# psort -o elastic plaso.dump
# There is no need to use logstash as data is directly stored in elasticsearch

# A simple dashboard is provided here: https://plaso.googlecode.com/git/extra/plaso_kibana_example.json
# More dashboard love will come in the near future. 


# You can also export to l2tcsv and then import the csv using logstash. However you will loose some data.
# If you choose the l2tcsv export, check out the other configuration and dashboard provided in this ELK-forensics repository
